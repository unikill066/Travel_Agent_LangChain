# Process Workflows

Process Workflows is a comprehensive system designed to assist users in planning and managing their travel experiences. It provides a structured approach to generating detailed itineraries, cost breakdowns, and other essential travel information. The system is built around the following core components:

## Architecture and Components

The system is composed of several interconnected tools and services, each responsible for a specific aspect of the travel planning process. The main components include:

### 1. **Place Explorer Tool**
This tool is responsible for gathering information about attractions, restaurants, and activities in a given city. It uses two primary search mechanisms: Google Places and Tavily Search. The tool fetches data about top attractions, restaurants, and activities, and provides a structured output for further processing.

### 2. **Weather Tool**
The Weather Tool provides real-time weather information for a given location. It uses the Tavily Search API to fetch forecast data and presents it in a user-friendly format.

### 3. **Expenses Calculation Tool**
This tool calculates the total costs associated with a trip, including hotel expenses, food, transport, and activities. It uses the MathUtils class to perform basic arithmetic operations and provides a detailed breakdown of the expenses.

### 4. **Data Processing and Integration**
The system integrates data from multiple sources, including Google Places, Tavily Search, and the Weather Tool. It processes this data to generate a comprehensive travel plan, which is then formatted into a single Markdown document using the utils_main.py module.

## Key Features and Functionality

### 1. **Itinerary Generation**
The system generates two parallel itineraries: one for the generic tourist places and another for more off-beat locations. Each itinerary includes:
- Day-by-day breakdowns of activities and travel routes
- Recommended hotels with nightly rates
- Places of attractions with details
- Recommended restaurants with prices
- Activities with details
- Modes of transportation available with costs
- Detailed cost breakdown
- Per day expense budget
- Weather details

### 2. **Data Integration and Curation**
The system uses Tavily Search to fetch data about attractions, restaurants, and activities. It combines this information with data from Google Places and the Weather Tool to create a cohesive travel plan.

### 3. **Cost Calculation**
The Expenses Calculation Tool uses the MathUtils class to calculate total costs. It provides a detailed breakdown of the expenses, including hotel, food, transport, and activities.

### 4. **Output Formatting**
The system formats the travel plan into a single Markdown document using the utils_main.py module. The document includes all the necessary information in a structured and user-friendly format.
