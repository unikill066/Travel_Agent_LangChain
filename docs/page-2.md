# Overview

This wiki page focuses on the `ExpensesCalcTool` module, which is designed to calculate and manage travel-related expenses for a given destination. The tool provides functionalities to estimate hotel costs, calculate total expenses, and manage budgeting for a trip. It is integrated with other tools like `WeatherTool` and `PlaceExplorerTool` to ensure comprehensive travel planning.

## Detailed Sections

### 1. Architecture and Components

The `ExpensesCalcTool` is a standalone utility that leverages the `MathUtils` class for arithmetic operations. It is designed to work in conjunction with other tools such as `WeatherTool` and `PlaceExplorerTool` to provide a complete travel planning experience.

### 2. Key Functions and Classes

- **`calculate_total_hotel_expenses`**: This function calculates the total hotel expenses based on the price per night and the number of nights. It uses the `MathUtils` class to perform the calculation.
- **`ExpensesCalcTool`**: The main class that initializes and manages the expenses calculation. It sets up the necessary tools and configurations.
- **`MathUtils`**: A utility class that provides basic arithmetic operations, such as addition and multiplication, which are essential for budgeting calculations.

### 3. Data Flow and Logic

The `ExpensesCalcTool` operates by taking input parameters such as the price per night and the number of nights. It then uses the `MathUtils` class to compute the total cost. The calculation is then returned as a float value.

### 4. Configuration and Parameters

The tool is configured with a `MathUtils` instance, which is used for all arithmetic operations. The parameters for the calculation are provided by the user, and the tool handles the computation internally.

### 6. Tables

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MathUtils` | Provides basic arithmetic operations for budgeting calculations. |
| `ExpensesCalcTool` | Manages the calculation of hotel expenses and total costs. |
| `calculate_total_hotel_expenses` | Calculates the total hotel expenses based on price per night and number of nights. |

### 7. Code Snippets

```python
# Example usage of calculate_total_hotel_expenses
def calculate_total_hotel_expenses(price_per_night: float, number_of_nights: float) -> float:
    return MathUtils.add(price_per_night, number_of_nights) * price_per_night
```
